# AWARE: Device


[![Swift Package Manager compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift%20Package%20Manager-compatible-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

The device sensor provides device manufacturer, model, operating system version and other information. The information is provided by [UIDevice](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice).

## Requirements
iOS 13 or later


## Installation

You can integrate this framework into your project via Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) or CocoaPods.

### SwiftPM
1. Open Package Manager Windows
    * Open `Xcode` -> Select `Menu Bar` -> `File` -> `App Package Dependencies...` 

2. Find the package using the manager
    * Select `Search Package URL` and type `git@github.com:awareframework/com.awareframework.ios.sensor.device.git`

3. Import the package into your target.

4. Import com.awareframework.ios.sensor.device library into your source code.
```swift
import com_awareframework_ios_sensor_device
```

### CocoaPods

com.aware.ios.sensor.device is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

1. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'com.awareframework.ios.sensor.device'
```

2. Import com.awareframework.ios.sensor.device library into your source code.
```swift
import com_awareframework_ios_sensor_device
```

## Public functions

### DeviceSensor

+ `init(config:DeviceSensor.Config?)` : Initializes the device sensor with the optional configuration.
+ `start()`: Starts the device sensor with the optional configuration.
+ `stop()`: Stops the service.

### DeviceSensor.Config

Class to hold the configuration of the sensor.

#### Fields

+ `sensorObserver: DeviceObserver?`: Callback for live data updates.
+ `enabled: Boolean` Sensor is enabled or not. (default = `false`)
+ `debug: Boolean` enable/disable logging to `Logcat`. (default = `false`)
+ `label: String` Label for the data. (default = "")
+ `deviceId: String` Id of the device that will be associated with the events and the sensor. (default = "")
+ `dbEncryptionKey` Encryption key for the database. (default = `null`)
+ `dbType: Engine` Which db engine to use for saving data. (default = `Engine.DatabaseType.REALM`)
+ `dbPath: String` Path of the database. (default = "aware_device")
+ `dbHost: String` Host for syncing the database. (default = `null`)

## Broadcasts

+ `DeviceSensor.ACTION_AWARE_DEVICE` fired when device is profiled.

## Data Representations

| os           | String | Operating system of the device (ex. android)                           |

## Example Usage
```swift
let deviceSensor = DeviceSensor.init(DeviceSensor.Config().apply{config in
    config.debug = true
    config.dbType = .REALM
    config.sensorObserver = Observer()
})
deviceSensor.start()
```

```swift
class Observer:DeviceOserver{
    func onDeviceChanged(data: DeviceData) {
        // Your code here..
    }
}

```
